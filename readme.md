# SewaSetu - Civic Issue Reporting Platform

SewaSetu is a modern, full-stack application designed to bridge the gap between citizens and local authorities. It empowers users to report civic issues (like potholes, streetlight outages, or waste management problems), which are then intelligently classified and routed to the appropriate municipal departments for resolution.

## üöÄ Live Demo

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started: Local Setup

Follow these steps to run the entire platform on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+ installed and in your PATH
- Node.js 16+ installed and in your PATH
- A Supabase account with a database configured

### 1. Clone & Configure

First, clone the repository and set up your environment variables.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/SewaSetu.git
cd SewaSetu
```

You must create a `.env` file in the `/backend` directory with your Supabase URL/Key, a secret key, and the local AI server URL.

```env
# backend/.env
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_key
API_SECRET_KEY=generate_a_strong_secret_key
AI_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/classify
```

### 2. Install & Run

#### Quick Start (Windows Users)

Convenience scripts are provided for a one-command setup.

**Install all dependencies:**
```bash
