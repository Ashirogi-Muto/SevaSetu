## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### **Database Schema (Existing)**
```sql
-- departments table (existing)
id, name, email, created_at, updated_at

-- category_department_mapping (existing)  
category_name, department_id

-- reports table (existing)
id, description, latitude, longitude, category, status, user_id, department_id, created_at
```

### **API Endpoints to Implement**
```
# Departments
GET /api/departments - List departments (alphabetical)
POST /api/departments - Create department  
PUT /api/departments/{id} - Update department
DELETE /api/departments/{id} - Soft delete

# Enhanced Reports  
GET /api/reports/all?status&category&department_id&date_from&date_to&center_lat&center_lng&radius_km
```

### **Frontend Components to Build**
- `DepartmentsPage.tsx` - Full CRUD interface
